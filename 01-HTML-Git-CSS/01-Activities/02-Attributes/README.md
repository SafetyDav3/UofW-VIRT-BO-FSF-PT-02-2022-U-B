# 🐛 Images and Styles Not Appearing on Page

Work with a partner to resolve the following issues:

* As a user, I should be able to see an image on the page, and `alt` text that describes the image should be provided.

* As a user, I should see background colors applied to each section and list item, and the header text should be dark blue.

## Expected Behavior

* When a user opens the page, an image should appear, and `alt` text describing the image should be provided.

* When a user opens the page, each section and list item should have a background color applied, and the header text should be dark blue.

## Actual Behavior

* When a user opens the page, no image appears and `alt` text describing the image is not shown.

* When a user opens the page, each section and list item does not have a background color applied.

* When a user opens the page, the header text is not dark blue.
